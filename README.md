## About
This is an Epicodus project for the Ruby OO Assessment.
The project lets two players play a virtual game of the old classic: "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Players input their names and play any number of rounds until the exit the program. After playing their first game, players may view the game's history, including who won each round and with what hand. The number of tie games is also displayed.
